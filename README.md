# A-B Testing

#### Experiment

Udacity experimented a change by adding a `Start Free Trial` button. Each visitor asked with how mnuch time they devote for a course. If the student indicate fewer than 5 hours per week than a message would appear saying `Udacity courses usually require a
greater time commitment for successful completion`, and indicating student might like to access free course material. 

## Experiment Design

Invariant Metrics: Number of Cookies, Number of Clicks

Evaluation Metrics: Gross Conversion, Retention, Net Conversion

1) Number of cookies counted before the studennt click `Strat Free Trial` and not affected with Experiment, so invariant metrics.

2) Number of users can be different before & after showing the `message`. Thus it cannot be invariant metrics. 

3) Number of clicks is invariant, because it counted before the experiment. 

4) Click through probablity is formed from 2 variables, number of unique cookoie to click `Start free Trial` & number of unique cookies to view the overview page. Both of this collected before starting of experiment, so this is invariant.
