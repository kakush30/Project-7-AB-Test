# A-B Testing

#### Experiment

Udacity experimented a change by adding a `Start Free Trial` button. Each visitor asked with how mnuch time they devote for a course. If the student indicate fewer than 5 hours per week than a message would appear saying `Udacity courses usually require a
greater time commitment for successful completion`, and indicating student might like to access free course material.
